Smart mixer with Python and Clingo where you can tell the A.I. which instruments to mix, the program modify volume, panning and reverb to the original audios and render just
one audio all together, you can decide how many mixes the program will give you. The intelligence is based on Answer Set Programming using Clingo.

### Installation

Note: The mixer was programed and tested in pycharm.

1. Pycharm: You can download Pycharm from official website https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=14127625370&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7oyNBhDiARIsADtGRZZBxy08Ea0VEnvRkC6ZV4FhQ7JZGJgwMfBwWvUusxN8vcqAQQMLU8waAmYkEALw_wcB
2. You should be able to run the code with spider, jupyter or console itself as well.
3. Install all dependencies (I recommend install all of them inside pycharm).
* Clingo: You can follow Clingo instructions from https://github.com/potassco/clingo repository
  - Python formula: ```pip install clingo``` 
  - Homebrew formula: ```brew install clingo```
  
* PyQT5 from https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ for GUI
  - Python formula: ```pip install PyQt5```
  
* Soundfile from https://pypi.org/project/SoundFile/ for reading and writing audio
  - Python formula: ```pip install soundfile``` 
  
* Pysndfx from https://github.com/carlthome/python-audio-effects for reverb
  - Python formula: ```pip install pysndfx```
